🏏 Cricket Match Analysis: Decoding the Game Through Data
This project explores the power of Big Data and Machine Learning to analyze cricket matches from 2002 to 2023. Using tools like PySpark, Google Cloud Platform, and Jupyter Notebook, we extract meaningful insights from historical data to assist in player selection, match strategy, and performance analysis.

📌 Project Overview
Cricket is a dynamic game where strategies evolve with every over. Traditional analysis methods often fail to capture deeper insights into team dynamics, player performances, and match outcomes. This project leverages big data analytics to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and actionable metrics.

📊 Functionalities
Dataset Overview: Analyze match data from Kaggle (2002–2023) using dataset.info() for structural insights.

Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values (imputation)

Remove duplicates

Standardize formatting

Detect and handle outliers

Validate data types

Data Analysis & Modeling: Use PySpark ML for regression models and statistical insights.

Visualization: Display trends and insights using matplotlib, seaborn, and PySpark SQL on GCP.

Cloud Deployment: Leverage GCP's Dataproc and Cloud Storage for scalable distributed analysis.

🧰 Technologies Used
Languages: Python (PySpark, Pandas, SparkML)

Frameworks: Apache Spark, Jupyter Notebook

Cloud Platform: Google Cloud Platform (Dataproc, Cloud Storage)
